This is a Microsoft SQL Report Server rs.exe script that can be used to back up all reports that are in a specified  Report Server folder.

Example usage:

rs -i ReportBackup.rss -s http://localhost:8080/ReportServer

To configure this script, you need to edit ReportBackup.rss and change the following lines under the "Configuration:" section:

Public ssrsPath As String = "/"
Public exportTo As String = "C:\Export"

ssrsPath - Set this to the parent folder in SSRS that you wish to back up. For example, setting this to "/" will back up all reports in all sub folders.
exportTo - Set this to the directory on disk where you want to back up the report .RDL files, without any trailing slash.
		The structure on disk will match the structure in ssrsPath.
